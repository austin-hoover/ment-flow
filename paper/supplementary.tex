\title{Supplementary Material for ``High-dimensional maximum-entropy phase space tomography using normalizing flows''}


\maketitle

The following figures repeat the numerical experiment in Fig.2 of the main text for different ground-truth distributions.

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{fig_rec_2d_rings.pdf}
    \caption{2D reconstruction of the ``rings'' distribution from evenly spaced 1D projections. The top four rows plot samples from the true distribution, MENT reconstruction, MENT-Flow reconstruction, and NN reconstruction. Faint lines show the evenly spaced projection angles, increasing from 1 in the left column to 7 in the right column. In the bottom rows, the distributions are projected onto the measurement axes. (The four profiles overlap in most cases.)}
